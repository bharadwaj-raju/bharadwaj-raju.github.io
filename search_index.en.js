watched this excellent video, Better Mountain Generators That Aren’t Perlin Noise or Erosion by Josh’s Channel. It discusses generating mountain heightmaps\nusing a technique called Diffusion-Limited Aggregation. The structures produced by this process are known as Brownian trees.\n\n    \n    Growing Brownian tree.Animation by あるうぃんす.\n\nIn DLA, we start with a seed typically placed at the center. At each step, we randomly place points on the grid and then random-walk them until they hit an existing particle, at which point they are frozen there. This is, of course, very inefficient. The video describes a good technique to get it to be faster, by starting with a small grid and doing a crisp upscale&nbsp;&nbsp;(This upscale isn’t done directly on the pixels — instead, we keep track of which pixel sticks to which, and use that graph to populate a larger grid.)&nbsp;\n after the grid is filled to a certain degree, and repeating the process until we get to the desired size.\nBut my immediate thoughts after the video were that surely this would be faster the other way round — by generating outwards from the initial seed. After experimenting with a lot of approaches, I found a way that yields fairly DLA-like results with much less computational cost.\nApproach\nWe have a number of random walkers on the grid. Each of them has these properties:\n\nAge: How many pixels it travelled since it was spawned.\nGeneration: How many parent walkers it has.\nAngle: What angle the walker aims towards.\nType: Is it a long or short walker. Short walkers don’t split into more walkers when they end.\n\nThe algorithm for generation is:\n\nStart with a grid of zeros.\nPlace a number of walkers at the centre, all aimed at different angles.\nWhile there are any walkers:\n\nIf it is a long walker and its age module some frequency parameter is zero, spawn a short walker at that position.\nIf its age is greater than some maximum age, it dies, and…\n\nIf its generation is less than some maximum generation, and it is a long walker, spawn some number of long walkers where it stopped, each aimed slightly offset from the parent’s angle.\n\n\nElse, the walker moves in a random direction, chosen via weighted sampling where the weights are smaller the larger the angular distance between that direction and the target angle, and the most opposite direction is removed&nbsp;&nbsp;(Otherwise, the walkers wind back on themselves and fail to spread apart sufficiently. An example of what that looks like: )&nbsp;\n by subtracting its weight from every weight. The point it moves to is filled in on the grid.\n\n\n\nImplementation\nI’ve written a Rust implementation of this algorithm.\n\nRepository: bharadwaj-raju / angled-random-walker\nCrates.io: angled-random-walker\nDocumentation: angled_random_walker on docs.rs\n\nHeightmap\nBy filling each walked pixel with the cumulative age of its walker, and blurring the result, we get a simple heightmap. But this just gives you mountain-like smooth blobs.\nTo get more interesting terrain, we superimpose a clamped and lightly-blurred version. This preserves the smaller and sharper details generated in the process. The effect is — in my estimation — close to the sought-after erosion look.\nDemonstration\nThis is a live demonstration. Play around with the sliders to immediately see your changes.

I was browsing LinkedIn&nbsp;&nbsp;(Not something I usually ever do, really.)&nbsp;\n looking at alumni from my university, when I saw that one of them, who was working as a kernel engineer at Google, had reposted an announcement for the LKMP. I clicked through and that was that.\nApplication &amp; Acceptance\nI had to create an account on the LFX Mentorship portal, fill out my profile and a small statement-of-purpose, and then I was given a list of tasks on the basis of which I would be accepted (or not). These tasks ranged from completing a beginner’s course in kernel development from LFX, to writing a cover letter, to building and experimenting with writing simple kernel modules, and even making patches for small mistakes we could find. I managed to get 5 minor patches into the kernel as part of these preliminary tasks.\nI finished my tasks and spent around a week or so awaiting the result. On the 26th of February, I got my acceptance email.\nStarting to Work\nI was invited to a Discord server for the mentees, and each Wednesday we had online meetings with our mentor Shuah Khan, where we covered various useful tools, discussed contribution opportunities, and got non-public (and less harsh) reviews and feedback on our patch attempts.\nI decided to focus on fixing bugs, and to that end I tried to fix bugs from syzkaller. It’s a hosted public dashboard for bugs found via the syz fuzzing system. These are mostly kernel warnings, and reports from KASAN (Kernel Address Sanitizer), KMSAN (Memory), and UBSAN (Undefined Behavior).\nThis was hard. Not all bugs had working reproducers, or were comprehensible to someone new to the subsystem — to say nothing of the false positives. Most of the viable ones would be solved by an actual kernel engineer faster than I could reproduce and investigate it.\nDespite this, I managed to get some bugfixes in bcachefs, from syzkaller. I’ll try to recount the process of investigating and fixing each bug in detail, in the hopes that it might be useful to others looking to fix kernel bugs.\nFixes in bcachefs\nI picked bcachefs mostly by chance; it happened to have several syzkaller reports when\nI looked at the dashboard, and they seemed approachable.\nAtomic Contexts and Blocking Functions\nI started by picking this syzkaller bug: BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context in bch2_printbuf_make_room\n(2).\nLet’s look at (the relevant parts of) the crash report.\nBUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at ./include/linux/sched/mm.h:321\nin_atomic(): 0, irqs_disabled(): 0, non_block: 0, pid: 5828, name: syz-executor246\npreempt_count: 0, expected: 0\nRCU nest depth: 1, expected: 0\n3 locks held by syz-executor246/5828:\n #0: ffff88807ad6a0e0 (&amp;type-&gt;s_umount_key#42/1){+.+.}-{4:4}, at: alloc_super+0x221/0x9d0 fs/super.c:344\n #1: ffff888075a84210 (&amp;c-&gt;btree_trans_barrier){.+.+}-{0:0}, at: srcu_lock_acquire include/linux/srcu.h:161 [inline]\n #1: ffff888075a84210 (&amp;c-&gt;btree_trans_barrier){.+.+}-{0:0}, at: srcu_read_lock include/linux/srcu.h:253 [inline]\n #1: ffff888075a84210 (&amp;c-&gt;btree_trans_barrier){.+.+}-{0:0}, at: __bch2_trans_get+0x7ed/0xd40 fs/bcachefs/btree_iter.c:3386\n #2: ffffffff8ed3b560 (rcu_read_lock){....}-{1:3}, at: rcu_lock_acquire include/linux/rcupdate.h:331 [inline]\n #2: ffffffff8ed3b560 (rcu_read_lock){....}-{1:3}, at: rcu_read_lock include/linux/rcupdate.h:841 [inline]\n #2: ffffffff8ed3b560 (rcu_read_lock){....}-{1:3}, at: bch2_bkey_pick_read_device+0x29c/0x19b0 fs/bcachefs/extents.c:144\nCPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 5828 Comm: syz-executor246 Not tainted 6.14.0-syzkaller-11270-g08733088b566 #0 PREEMPT(full) \nHardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 02/12/2025\nCall Trace:\n &lt;TASK&gt;\n __dump_stack lib/dump_stack.c:94 [inline]\n dump_stack_lvl+0x241/0x360 lib/dump_stack.c:120\n __might_resched+0x558/0x6c0 kernel/sched/core.c:8818\n might_alloc include/linux/sched/mm.h:321 [inline]\n slab_pre_alloc_hook mm/slub.c:4089 [inline]\n slab_alloc_node mm/slub.c:4167 [inline]\n __do_kmalloc_node mm/slub.c:4317 [inline]\n __kmalloc_node_track_caller_noprof+0xd3/0x4d0 mm/slub.c:4337\n __do_krealloc mm/slub.c:4895 [inline]\n krealloc_noprof+0x10f/0x300 mm/slub.c:4948\n bch2_printbuf_make_room+0x1f1/0x350 fs/bcachefs/printbuf.c:59\n bch2_prt_printf+0x269/0x6d0 fs/bcachefs/printbuf.c:186\n bch2_log_msg_start fs/bcachefs/error.c:19 [inline]\n bch2_fs_trans_inconsistent fs/bcachefs/error.c:63 [inline]\n bch2_fs_inconsistent+0x143/0x220 fs/bcachefs/error.c:81\n bch2_dev_rcu fs/bcachefs/sb-members.h:226 [inline]\n bch2_bkey_pick_read_device+0x95e/0x19b0 fs/bcachefs/extents.c:165\n bch2_btree_node_read+0x7ac/0x29e0 fs/bcachefs/btree_io.c:1706\n __bch2_btree_root_read fs/bcachefs/btree_io.c:1796 [inline]\n bch2_btree_root_read+0x656/0x7e0 fs/bcachefs/btree_io.c:1818\n read_btree_roots+0x3d7/0xa80 fs/bcachefs/recovery.c:581\n bch2_fs_recovery+0x28e4/0x3e20 fs/bcachefs/recovery.c:928\n bch2_fs_start+0x2fb/0x610 fs/bcachefs/super.c:1060\n bch2_fs_get_tree+0x113e/0x18f0 fs/bcachefs/fs.c:2253\n vfs_get_tree+0x90/0x2b0 fs/super.c:1759\n do_new_mount+0x2cf/0xb70 fs/namespace.c:3878\n do_mount fs/namespace.c:4218 [inline]\n __do_sys_mount fs/namespace.c:4429 [inline]\n __se_sys_mount+0x38c/0x400 fs/namespace.c:4406\n do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:63 [inline]\n do_syscall_64+0xf3/0x230 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:94\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f\n\nNow, where do we look for the bug? The first thing to look for is the last bcachefs function in the call trace, because it is a reasonable assumption that the bug is in bcachefs code and not in core kernel memory management code. That is bch2_printbuf_make_room.\nRight, but what is an “invalid context” anyway? Researching the error message&nbsp;&nbsp;(Even good old StackOverflow suffices.)&nbsp;\n will tell us that “invalid” here is “atomic”. You can’t call a function which may sleep from an atomic context.\nAlthough we don’t need this to solve the bug, we might as well ask ourselves why we’re in an atomic context here. The reason can be seen in the locks held part of the report, which lists an rcu_read_lock held by bch2_bkey_pick_read_device. It is illegal to block while in an RCU read-side critical section.&nbsp;&nbsp;(https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/RCU/whatisRCU.html#rcu-read-lock)&nbsp;\n\nWhat are the offending functions? Let’s look at what bch2_printbuf_make_room is doing, exactly.\n​&nbsp;(fs/bcachefs/printbuf.c)&nbsp;int bch2_printbuf_make_room(struct printbuf *out, unsigned extra)\n{\n\t…\n  \n\t/*\n\t * Note: output buffer must be freeable with kfree(), it's not required\n\t * that the user use printbuf_exit().\n\t */\n\tchar *buf = krealloc(out-&gt;buf, new_size, !out-&gt;atomic ? GFP_KERNEL : GFP_NOWAIT);\n\n\tif (!buf) {\n\t\tout-&gt;allocation_failure = true;\n\t\tout-&gt;overflow = true;\n\t\treturn -ENOMEM;\n\t}\n\n\tout-&gt;buf\t= buf;\n\tout-&gt;size\t= new_size;\n\treturn 0;\n}\n\nThat krealloc call is what the crash report is complaining about as well. It’s interesting that the call does seem to think about atomicity, from the !out-&gt;atomic ? GFP_KERNEL : GFP_NOWAIT. Then, out-&gt;atomic must not be correctly maintained? Let’s step back in the call trace and look at how the caller is using this struct printbuf.\nFirst we would look at bch2_prt_printf, but that’s not where the struct printbuf is constructed. Neither is it one more step back, in bch2_log_msg_start. Finally we see it being constructed in bch2_fs_trans_inconsistent:\n​&nbsp;(fs/bcachefs/error.c)&nbsp;__printf(3, 0)\nstatic bool bch2_fs_trans_inconsistent(struct bch_fs *c, struct btree_trans *trans,\n\t\t\t\t       const char *fmt, va_list args)\n{\n\tstruct printbuf buf = PRINTBUF;\n\n\tbch2_log_msg_start(c, &amp;buf);\n\n\tprt_vprintf(&amp;buf, fmt, args);\n\tprt_newline(&amp;buf);\n\n\tif (trans)\n\t\tbch2_trans_updates_to_text(&amp;buf, trans);\n\tbool ret = __bch2_inconsistent_error(c, &amp;buf);\n\tbch2_print_string_as_lines(KERN_ERR, buf.buf);\n\n\tprintbuf_exit(&amp;buf);\n\treturn ret;\n}\n\nand expanding the PRINTBUF macro…\n​&nbsp;(fs/bcachefs/printbuf.h)&nbsp;/* Initializer for a heap allocated printbuf: */\n#define PRINTBUF ((struct printbuf) { .heap_allocated = true })\n\nSo buf.atomic is 0. Hence the krealloc call is made with GFP_KERNEL, which is potentially blocking. How do we correctly handle this .atomic field? Let’s look for examples in fs/bcachefs.\n❯ rg -F '.atomic'\njournal.c\n145:    buf.atomic++;\n273:            pbuf.atomic++;\n287:            err.atomic++;\n\nbtree_io.c\n2246:           buf.atomic++;\n\nerror.c\n46:     buf.atomic++;\n62:     buf.atomic++;\n\ndebug.c\n515:            i-&gt;buf.atomic++;\n531:            --i-&gt;buf.atomic;\n\njournal_reclaim.c\n225:                    buf.atomic++;\n\nalloc_foreground.c\n1638:   buf.atomic++;\n1647:   --buf.atomic;\n\nbtree_locking.c\n164:            buf.atomic++;\n200:    buf.atomic++;\n\nAlright. So we’re supposed to increment the .atomic field before working with the buffer, and decrement it when done. Let’s do that. It should be fixed now, right?\nNope, we get a similar crash. What gives? Turns out there’s one more blocking function left in this codepath. It’s bch2_print_string_as_lines, due to it calling console_lock. Luckily for us, there is a direct replacement function already there, called… bch2_print_string_as_lines_nonblocking. We just replace the call, and we’re finally done.\n​&nbsp;(Kent Overstreet is really nice, by the way. He even suggested possible further work in that thread for me. Namely, trying to replace print_string_as_lines entirely by calling something lower-level which didn’t have the 1k chars limitation of printk. Unfortunately I did not find a straightforward lower function to printk that would’ve done what we wanted, but still.)&nbsp;\nNow, having done this, I submitted my patch to the bcachefs mailing list, only to be told by Kent Overstreet that he had beat me to it. But! He hadn’t replaced the bch2_print_string_as_lines call, which meant the issue wasn’t fully fixed, and I still had a contribution to make. I made another patch doing only that, and it was accepted.\nError Paths, 1\nThe bug this time is UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in __bch2_bkey_unpack_key.\nCrash report:\nUBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in fs/bcachefs/bkey.c:163:16\nshift exponent 4294967127 is too large for 64-bit type 'u64' (aka 'unsigned long long')\nCPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 5832 Comm: read_btree_node Not tainted 6.15.0-syzkaller-01958-g785cdec46e92 #0 PREEMPT(full) \nHardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 05/07/2025\nCall Trace:\n &lt;TASK&gt;\n dump_stack_lvl+0x189/0x250 lib/dump_stack.c:120\n ubsan_epilogue+0xa/0x40 lib/ubsan.c:231\n __ubsan_handle_shift_out_of_bounds+0x386/0x410 lib/ubsan.c:492\n get_inc_field fs/bcachefs/bkey.c:163 [inline]\n __bch2_bkey_unpack_key+0xdc4/0xe10 fs/bcachefs/bkey.c:284\n __bch2_bkey_compat+0x4db/0xbd0 fs/bcachefs/bkey_methods.c:480\n bch2_bkey_compat fs/bcachefs/bkey_methods.h:134 [inline]\n validate_bset_keys+0x6c1/0x1390 fs/bcachefs/btree_io.c:983\n bch2_btree_node_read_done+0x18c8/0x4f60 fs/bcachefs/btree_io.c:1211\n btree_node_read_work+0x426/0xe30 fs/bcachefs/btree_io.c:1400\n bch2_btree_node_read+0x887/0x29f0 fs/bcachefs/btree_io.c:-1\n bch2_btree_node_fill+0xd12/0x14f0 fs/bcachefs/btree_cache.c:994\n bch2_btree_node_get_noiter+0xa2c/0x1000 fs/bcachefs/btree_cache.c:1261\n found_btree_node_is_readable fs/bcachefs/btree_node_scan.c:85 [inline]\n try_read_btree_node fs/bcachefs/btree_node_scan.c:220 [inline]\n read_btree_nodes_worker+0x1319/0x1e20 fs/bcachefs/btree_node_scan.c:269\n kthread+0x711/0x8a0 kernel/kthread.c:464\n ret_from_fork+0x4e/0x80 arch/x86/kernel/process.c:148\n ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30 arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:245\n &lt;/TASK&gt;\n---[ end trace ]---\n\nThat shift exponent does look too large.

Shift exponents are unsigned, so bits must have been greater than 64 to cause a huge value when cast. We can calculate (or printk) to see that bits == 233.\nSo state-&gt;format has invalid values. Where does it come from? If we follow it up the call stack, we see that it comes from struct btree itself and is passed here:\n​&nbsp;(fs/bcachefs/btree_io.c)&nbsp;static int validate_bset_keys(struct bch_fs *c, struct btree *b,\n\t\t\t struct bset *i, int write,\n\t\t\t struct bch_io_failures *failed,\n\t\t\t struct printbuf *err_msg)\n{\n\n\t\t…\n\n\t\tif (!write)\n\t\t\tbch2_bkey_compat(b-&gt;c.level, b-&gt;c.btree_id, version,\n\t\t\t\t    BSET_BIG_ENDIAN(i), write,\n\t\t\t\t    &amp;b-&gt;format, k);\n\n\t\t…\n\n}\n\nWell… what now? Let’s look at where validate_bset_keys is being called from here.\n​&nbsp;(fs/bcachefs/btree_io.c)&nbsp;int bch2_btree_node_read_done(struct bch_fs *c, struct bch_dev *ca,\n\t\t\t      struct btree *b,\n\t\t\t      struct bch_io_failures *failed,\n\t\t\t      struct printbuf *err_msg)\n{\n\t\t…\n    \n\t\tret = validate_bset(c, ca, b, i, b-&gt;written, sectors, READ, failed, err_msg);\n\t\tif (ret)\n\t\t\tgoto fsck_err;\n\n\t\tif (!b-&gt;written)\n\t\t\tbtree_node_set_format(b, b-&gt;data-&gt;format);\n\n\t\tret = validate_bset_keys(c, b, i, READ, failed, err_msg);\n\t\tif (ret)\n\t\t\tgoto fsck_err;\n\n\t\t…\n}\n\nThere’s a lot of validation functions in the surrounding code, which is interesting. If validate_bset_keys fails on an invalid format, then maybe it expects a previous validation step to have caught it? There’s some reference to btree_node_set_format immediately after validate_bset, so let’s see if there’s anything relevant to us there. Turns out there isn’t any validation in btree_node_set_format itself, so maybe it’s happening before. Let’s read validate_bset instead. It’s a huge function, nevertheless a careful reading rewards us:\n​&nbsp;(fs/bcachefs/btree_io.c)&nbsp;static int validate_bset(struct bch_fs *c, struct bch_dev *ca,\n\t\t\t struct btree *b, struct bset *i,\n\t\t\t unsigned offset, unsigned sectors, int write,\n\t\t\t struct bch_io_failures *failed,\n\t\t\t struct printbuf *err_msg)\n{\n\t\t…\n\n\t\tbtree_err_on(bch2_bkey_format_invalid(c, &amp;bn-&gt;format, write, &amp;buf1),\n\t\t\t     -BCH_ERR_btree_node_read_err_bad_node,\n\t\t\t     c, ca, b, i, NULL,\n\t\t\t     btree_node_bad_format,\n\t\t\t     \"invalid bkey format: %s\\n%s\", buf1.buf,\n\t\t\t     (printbuf_reset(&amp;buf2),\n\t\t\t      bch2_bkey_format_to_text(&amp;buf2, &amp;bn-&gt;format), buf2.buf));\n\n\t\t…\n}\n\nSo there is a function to validate the format after all! So, the question becomes: why did it not catch the invalid format? Adding a printk to log its result tells us that it does return -BCH_ERR_invalid. What gives?\nThe answer is in btree_err_on, and how it deals with btree_node_bad_format errors.\n​&nbsp;(fs/bcachefs/btree_io.c)&nbsp;#define btree_err(type, c, ca, b, i, k, _err_type, msg, ...)\t\t\\\n({\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\\n\tint _ret = __btree_err(type, c, ca, b, i, k, write,\t\t\\\n\t\t\t       BCH_FSCK_ERR_##_err_type,\t\t\\\n\t\t\t       failed, err_msg,\t\t\t\t\\\n\t\t\t       msg, ##__VA_ARGS__);\t\t\t\\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\\n\tif (_ret != -BCH_ERR_fsck_fix) {\t\t\t\t\\\n\t\tret = _ret;\t\t\t\t\t\t\\\n\t\tgoto fsck_err;\t\t\t\t\t\t\\\n\t}\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\\n\ttrue;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\\n})\n\n#define btree_err_on(cond, ...)\t((cond) ? btree_err(__VA_ARGS__) : false)\n\nSo, the jump to fsck_err is only made if the return value from __btree_err is not -BCH_ERR_fsck_fix. Let’s look at what __btree_err does, then.\n​&nbsp;(fs/bcachefs/btree_io.c)&nbsp;__printf(11, 12)\nstatic int __btree_err(int ret,\n\t\t       struct bch_fs *c,\n\t\t       struct bch_dev *ca,\n\t\t       struct btree *b,\n\t\t       struct bset *i,\n\t\t       struct bkey_packed *k,\n\t\t       int rw,\n\t\t       enum bch_sb_error_id err_type,\n\t\t       struct bch_io_failures *failed,\n\t\t       struct printbuf *err_msg,\n\t\t       const char *fmt, ...)\n{\n\tif (c-&gt;recovery.curr_pass == BCH_RECOVERY_PASS_scan_for_btree_nodes)\n\t\treturn -BCH_ERR_fsck_fix;\n\n\t…\n}\n\nAnd that’s it (confirmed by a bit of logging). If the current recovery pass is “scan for btree nodes”, then all kinds of errors will be turned into -BCH_ERR_fsck_fix.\nThis offending line was added in cd3cdb1ef706. Previously it would have returned __bch2_topology_error(c, &amp;out).\nBased on that I made my first patch, but based on feedback I sent a simpler second patch, which was accepted. The function now checks if it is -BCH_ERR_btree_node_read_err_fixable before returning fsck_fix.\nError Paths, 2\nThe bug at hand: UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in __bch2_btree_node_hash_insert.\n  node offset 0/16 bset u64s 0: incorrect max key U64_MAX:18374686479671623680:50331647, btree topology error: \nbcachefs (loop0): flagging btree xattrs lost data\nbcachefs (loop0): running explicit recovery pass check_backpointers_to_extents (16), currently at recovery_pass_empty (0)\nbcachefs (loop0): running explicit recovery pass scan_for_btree_nodes (1), currently at recovery_pass_empty (0)\nbcachefs (loop0): error reading btree root btree=xattrs level=0: btree_node_read_error, fixing\n------------[ cut here ]------------\nUBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in fs/bcachefs/btree_cache.c:218:18\nshift exponent 251 is too large for 64-bit type 'unsigned long long'\nCPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 5830 Comm: syz-executor323 Not tainted 6.15.0-rc1-syzkaller-00246-g900241a5cc15 #0 PREEMPT(full) \nHardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 02/12/2025\nCall Trace:\n &lt;TASK&gt;\n __dump_stack lib/dump_stack.c:94 [inline]\n dump_stack_lvl+0x241/0x360 lib/dump_stack.c:120\n ubsan_epilogue lib/ubsan.c:231 [inline]\n __ubsan_handle_shift_out_of_bounds+0x3c8/0x420 lib/ubsan.c:492\n __btree_node_pinned fs/bcachefs/btree_cache.c:218 [inline]\n __bch2_btree_node_hash_insert+0x1b32/0x1ba0 fs/bcachefs/btree_cache.c:294\n bch2_btree_node_hash_insert+0x7e/0xc0 fs/bcachefs/btree_cache.c:309\n __bch2_btree_root_read fs/bcachefs/btree_io.c:1791 [inline]\n bch2_btree_root_read+0x605/0x7e0 fs/bcachefs/btree_io.c:1819\n read_btree_roots+0x3d7/0xa80 fs/bcachefs/recovery.c:581\n bch2_fs_recovery+0x28e4/0x3e20 fs/bcachefs/recovery.c:928\n bch2_fs_start+0x310/0x620 fs/bcachefs/super.c:1059\n bch2_fs_get_tree+0x113e/0x18f0 fs/bcachefs/fs.c:2253\n vfs_get_tree+0x90/0x2b0 fs/super.c:1759\n do_new_mount+0x2cf/0xb70 fs/namespace.c:3879\n do_mount fs/namespace.c:4219 [inline]\n __do_sys_mount fs/namespace.c:4430 [inline]\n __se_sys_mount+0x38c/0x400 fs/namespace.c:4407\n do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:63 [inline]\n do_syscall_64+0xf3/0x230 arch/x86/entry/syscall_64.c:94\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f\nRIP: 0033:0x7f3aa1b3afaa\nCode: d8 64 89 02 48 c7 c0 ff ff ff ff eb a6 e8 5e 04 00 00 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 0f 1f 40 00 49 89 ca b8 a5 00 00 00 0f 05 &lt;48&gt; 3d 01 f0 ff ff 73 01 c3 48 c7 c1 b8 ff ff ff f7 d8 64 89 01 48\nRSP: 002b:00007ffe042c3768 EFLAGS: 00000282 ORIG_RAX: 00000000000000a5\nRAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 00007ffe042c3780 RCX: 00007f3aa1b3afaa\nRDX: 0000200000000180 RSI: 0000200000000540 RDI: 00007ffe042c3780\nRBP: 0000200000000540 R08: 00007ffe042c37c0 R09: 0000000000005964\nR10: 0000000000800000 R11: 0000000000000282 R12: 0000200000000180\nR13: 00007ffe042c37c0 R14: 0000000000000003 R15: 0000000000800000\n &lt;/TASK&gt;\n---[ end trace ]---\n\nLet’s look at the last function to see what exactly is invalid.\n​&nbsp;(fs/bcachefs/btree_cache.c)&nbsp;static inline bool __btree_node_pinned(struct btree_cache *bc, struct btree *b)\n{\n\tstruct bbpos pos = BBPOS(b-&gt;c.btree_id, b-&gt;key.k.p);\n\n\tu64 mask = bc-&gt;pinned_nodes_mask[!!b-&gt;c.level];\n\n\treturn ((mask &amp; BIT_ULL(b-&gt;c.btree_id)) &amp;&amp;\n\t\tbbpos_cmp(bc-&gt;pinned_nodes_start, pos) &lt; 0 &amp;&amp;\n\t\tbbpos_cmp(bc-&gt;pinned_nodes_end, pos) &gt;= 0);\n}\n\nBIT_ULL(nr) expands to 1ULL &lt;&lt; nr. So b-&gt;c.btree_id is too large at 251.\nBut… what are the valid values for btree_id? Where does it come from, and where is it validated, if anywhere?\nThere are many ways you could try to research these questions. What I did was just search for btree_id in the codebase and scan through for interesting instances.​&nbsp;(With some more forethought, you could save time by assuming that a validation check, if it existed, would probably be in the form of btree_id\\s+(&gt;|&lt;) and search for that.)&nbsp;\nI found this:\n​&nbsp;(fs/bcachefs/recovery.c)&nbsp;static int journal_replay_entry_early(struct bch_fs *c,\n\t\t\t\t      struct jset_entry *entry)\n{\n\tint ret = 0;\n\n\tswitch (entry-&gt;type) {\n\tcase BCH_JSET_ENTRY_btree_root: {\n\n\t\tif (unlikely(!entry-&gt;u64s))\n\t\t\treturn 0;\n\n\t\tif (fsck_err_on(entry-&gt;btree_id &gt;= BTREE_ID_NR_MAX,\n\t\t\t\tc, invalid_btree_id,\n\t\t\t\t\"invalid btree id %u (max %u)\",\n\t\t\t\tentry-&gt;btree_id, BTREE_ID_NR_MAX))\n\t\t\treturn 0;\n\n\t\t…\n}\n\nExamining the functions in the call trace will show that this function is indeed called before the failure point.\nThis seems familiar to the previous case, doesn’t it? There’s a validation check in place, but it doesn’t actually stop the code from proceeding, for whatever reason. Let’s find out.\nThis check was introduced in 9e7cfb35e266. A later commit, 141526548052, introduced this bug. It is worthwhile to see what exactly these two commits do.\nThe first introduces a new error type called invalid_btree_id in sb-errors_format.h.​&nbsp;(sb stands for superblock.)&nbsp; The second marks the error types btree_root_bkey_invalid and btree_root_read_error as FSCK_AUTOFIX. Why did that make the bug happen? Look at these lines from the crash report, just before UBSAN blows up:\n  node offset 0/16 bset u64s 0: incorrect max key U64_MAX:18374686479671623680:50331647, btree topology error: \nbcachefs (loop0): flagging btree xattrs lost data\nbcachefs (loop0): running explicit recovery pass check_backpointers_to_extents (16), currently at recovery_pass_empty (0)\nbcachefs (loop0): running explicit recovery pass scan_for_btree_nodes (1), currently at recovery_pass_empty (0)\nbcachefs (loop0): error reading btree root btree=xattrs level=0: btree_node_read_error, fixing\n\nIt looks as if marking btree_root_read_error as autofix caused us to attempt to fix it (as expected), and that codepath ran into this issue.\nBack to why the validation check didn’t work. Once again, let’s look at how fsck_err_on actually works. Long story short, it expands into a bunch of macros:\n​&nbsp;(fs/bcachefs/error.h\nNote that in the call we’re looking at, _err_type is invalid_btree_id, and _flags is FSCK_CAN_FIX|FSCK_CAN_IGNORE.)&nbsp;#define bch2_fsck_err(c, _flags, _err_type, ...)\t\t\t\t\\\n\t__bch2_fsck_err(type_is(c, struct bch_fs *) ?

However, it was pointed out that we can just mark invalid_btree_id autofix as well, and then __bch2_fsck_err would (auto)fix it. So that’s what my second patch did, and was accepted.\nFalse Positives from KMSAN\nI spent a lot of time trying and failing to investigate this bug: KMSAN: uninit-value in bch2_btree_ptr_v2_validate. I did not see how the value in question was possibly uninitialized.\nUntil shortly after, when this patch series was posted to the linux-bcachefs mailing list which showed that most of the KMSAN bugs recorded against bcachefs were spurious: [PATCH&nbsp;0/5] kmsan splat fixes.\nKMSAN doesn’t understand memcpys implemented using inline assembly, and it has trouble when a struct’s fields are initialized via stores to bitfields.\nI learned that I could stand to take a little more seriously my suspicions of sanitizers when their reports didn’t seem to match up to what I saw. I had it in the back of my mind, but my inexperience made me apprehensive of just dismissing a report from an established tool. All in all, educational despite me not getting a bugfix out of this one.\nSensor Driver\nI spent the rest of my time developing an IIO kernel driver for the InvenSense ICM-20948 sensor, which combines an accelerometer, gyrometer, and magnetometer. This post is long enough as it is, so I’ll talk about that another time. Maybe when it’s actually merged.\nReflections\nI split my time during this program between bugfixes and driver development. I semi-intentionally eschewed those  contribution opportunities which were in the shape of “find and update uses of this old API to the new one” firstly because I did not find them that interesting to work on, and also because as I observed with my peers, a lot of such patches were seen as churn and rejected by maintainers&nbsp;&nbsp;(For a particularly incisive example, see Re: [PATCH] xfs: replace strncpy with strscpy.)&nbsp;\n.\nBeing in the LKMP was as rewarding as it was challenging. If you’re interested in becoming a kernel developer, I recommend it wholeheartedly. The program structure is extremely flexible, so you can do it alongside other obligations. Contributing to the Linux kernel can be rather daunting and even discouraging, so having a mentor to guide you through the initial troubles is really valuable.\nFinally… thank you to Shuah Khan, Ricardo B. Marlière, and Javier Carrasco!\n","id":"https://bharadwaj-raju.github.io/posts/kernel-mentorship/","title":"Being in the Linux Kernel Mentorship"},"https://bharadwaj-raju.github.io/posts/nothing-ear-2-on-linux/":{"body":"I bought a Nothing Ear (2), and I’m mostly happy with it. It comes \nwith a neat-looking Android app to let you set the noise cancellation level and equalization and such.\nThat’s fine, but it would be cool to be able to control it from my Linux computer as well. So here we are. \nWe’re going to reverse-engineer the Bluetooth protocol that it speaks, and from there \ndevelop a Linux controller. In the spirit of Nothing Chats, I’m sure Carl Pei would be appreciative.\nIf you don’t want to read the technical details of how this was achieved, skip to the Finished Product.\n\n    There exists a reverse-engineered controller for the Ear (2) already! It’s called Ear (PC). It’s great and looks sleek, but unfortunately it’s Windows-only, and the actual Bluetooth communication code is not released and kept private for “the security of the users”. That’s no good for us.\nAll the things that didn’t work\nThis was the first time I had reverse engineered anything. I ran down a lot of dead ends:\n\n\nDecompiling the actual Android app.\nThe generated assembly (Smali) and decompiled Java code are just unreadable.\n\n\nMonitoring Bluetooth traffic from my Android.\nDoing this live would need root, or specialized hardware like the Ubertooth One.\n\n\nMonitoring Bluetooth traffic from Waydroid.\nWaydroid does not support Bluetooth passthrough.\n\n\nFinally I thought of running Android-x86 in a VM, giving it Bluetooth, and analyzing traffic from there.\nAt this point I should thank Michal Jirků. While searching about snooping on \nAndroid-x86 traffic from the host, I found their series of posts on doing a very similar thing for their Yamaha \nYAS-207. That confirmed that I had indeed stumbled on a productive approach.\nSnooping on Bluetooth from Android-x86\nSo I set up an Android-x86 VM on VirtualBox and passed through Bluetooth.\n\n    Bluetooth didn’t work on the Android-x86 guest at first. I had to run these commands as root on the Android (from user Jikodis on this issue):\n# hciconfig hci0 down\n# pm disable com.android.bluetooth\n# pm enable com.android.bluetooth\n# service call bluetooth_manager 6\n# hciconfig hci0 up\n\nTry that if Bluetooth doesn’t work despite you enabling passthrough of the Bluetooth USB device.\nOne more thing: if you pass through Bluetooth to one VM session, you might have to reboot your host to get it back. There’s probably some command that does that without rebooting, but this is just so you keep the possibility in mind.\n\nAfter a lot of fiddling with the Android Bluetooth settings, restarting, and so on, finally:\n\n    \n    Look at the pixelation on those images. This app wasn’t built with this DPI in mind.\n\nAfter setting up developer options to enable Bluetooth HCI sniffing and USB debugging, we can connect via ADB&nbsp;&nbsp;(See the “using adb with a NAT’ed VM” section in the Android-x86 docs. Change the adb localhost:5555 command to adb connect localhost:5555.)&nbsp;\n.\nOnce we’ve connected ADB, we can simply select the Android device in Wireshark running on the host, and get our first look at the Bluetooth traffic.\n\nThe whole thing appears to be very chatty; there are nearly 300 events when I do something as simple as changing the ANC mode. Presumably only some of them are actually relevant, but that is a lot to sift through.\nProtocol Analysis\nOne neat trick: if you disconnect and reconnect the earphones while a Wireshark capture is running, the capture logs get a lot more detailed! Compare this to the previous screenshot:\n\nAll the “Connection oriented channel” packets get turned into actual commands and responses with the correct protocol! Great.\nFrom this we can sift through the packets better. The first thing I tested was switching between having the ANC off and on transparency mode. If we leave the huge PT=Unknown packets of ~592 bytes alone for a minute, we’ll observe ​&nbsp;(This observation didn’t come directly. I wasted a lot of time chasing even more dead ends like trying to connect to the Audio Sink service.)&nbsp; that every time the ANC is set to transparency, a lot of commands are sent over RFCOMM to channel 15:\nLet’s try manually constructing and sending these packets to the device, back on desktop Linux. I used Wireshark to filter all packets of channel 15 and saved it as JSON,\nthen wrote a quick Python script to read all the packets and send them out, with a 1 second gap to let me observe the effects. When I ran it, I finally heard that sigh in my ear that signalled transparency mode. This is the packet that does it:\n55:60:01:0f:f0:03:00:cb:01:07:00:c5:af\n\nThis is clearly the right track. After trying more captured packets, here is the table of commands to do various operations:\nCommandPacket\nANC Transparency55:60:01:0f:f0:03:00:cb:01:07:00:c5:af\nANC Off55:60:01:0f:f0:03:00:cd:01:05:00:c4:47\nANC High55:60:01:0f:f0:03:00:cf:01:01:00:e6:6f\nANC Mid55:60:01:0f:f0:03:00:d5:01:02:00:e6:9f\nANC Low55:60:01:0f:f0:03:00:d7:01:03:00:e7:0f\nANC Adaptive55:60:01:0f:f0:03:00:dd:01:04:00:e5:3f\nIn-ear detection Off55:60:01:04:f0:03:00:25:01:01:00:b2:94\nIn-ear detection On55:60:01:04:f0:03:00:26:01:01:01:73:10\nLow-latency mode Off55:60:01:40:f0:02:00:28:02:00:a7:04\nLow-latency mode On55:60:01:40:f0:02:00:27:01:00:97:f7\n\nEar Tip Fit Test\nThe packet to start an ear tip fit test is 55:60:01:14:f0:01:00:2a:01:43:16. We get back some results indicating if the left and right earbuds fit well.\nIf the left earbud doesn’t fit, but the right does, we get this packet:\n0000   55 00 01 0d e0 02 00 00 01 00\n\nIf both earbuds fit:\n0000   55 00 01 0d e0 02 00 00 00 00\n\nWe can make a good guess that the last two bytes represent 0 = good fit, 1 = bad fit, for L/R respectively (further testing confirms this).\nDevice Info\nIf we look at the first few packets exchanged when a connection is made on the Android app, and experiment with sending them, we notice that sending 55:60:01:42:c0:00:00:03:e0:d1 gives us this reply, which contains the firmware version (1.0.1.101):\n0000   55 60 01 42 40 09 00 03 31 2e 30 2e 31 2e 31 30   U`.B@...1.0.1.10\n0010   31 fa 36                                          1.6\n\nThe version number is 9 characters, so it’s possible the 6th byte 09 encodes this length information. I guess we’ll test this theory if we ever get a firmware update that changes the number of digits.\nAnd if we send 55:60:01:06:c0:00:00:05:90:dc, we get this:\n0000   55 60 01 06 40 88 00 05 09 32 2c 31 2c 31 2e 30   U`..@....2,1,1.0\n0010   2e 31 0a 32 2c 32 2c 31 2e 30 2e 31 2e 31 30 31   .1.2,2,1.0.1.101\n0020   0a 32 2c 34 2c 53 48 31 30 31 38 32 33 30 37 30   .2,4,SH101823070\n0030   30 32 38 30 37 0a 33 2c 31 2c 31 2e 30 2e 31 0a   02807.3,1,1.0.1.\n0040   33 2c 32 2c 31 2e 30 2e 31 2e 31 30 31 0a 33 2c   3,2,1.0.1.101.3,\n0050   34 2c 53 48 31 30 31 38 32 33 30 37 30 30 32 38   4,SH101823070028\n0060   30 37 0a 34 2c 31 2c 31 2e 30 2e 31 0a 34 2c 32   07.4,1,1.0.1.4,2\n0070   2c 31 2e 30 2e 31 2e 31 30 31 0a 34 2c 34 2c 53   ,1.0.1.101.4,4,S\n0080   48 31 30 31 38 32 33 30 37 30 30 32 38 30 37 0a   H10182307002807.\n0090   91 d1                                             ..\n\nThat string starting with SH101 is the serial number.\nIf you open an RFCOMM channel 15 and listen for every incoming packet, you’ll notice that a packet is sent for every “change” to the device. For example, if I change the ANC, I get a packet starting with 55:00:01:03:e0. Now, can I get the ANC status on demand, without there being a change? For this I looked at more packets sent during early communication, to see which got different responses when I changed the ANC. I found that when I sent 55:60:01:1e:c0:01:00:0c:03:98:19, I get:\n0000   55 60 01 1e 40 06 00 0c 01 07 00 02 04 00 10 7a\n\nThe 10th byte appears to correspond to the ANC.\n​&nbsp;(Which, we can notice, is the same as the 10th byte in the command to set ANC. Turns out we can simplify those seemingly-different ANC commands to just one with the 10th byte alone differing.)&nbsp;\nByteANC Mode\n7Transparency\n5Off\n4Adaptive\n3Low\n2Mid\n1High\n\nShortcuts\nThe Ear (2) has a number of different pinch/hold controls.\nWhenever we click on the controls for the left earbud, the app sends out 55:60:01:18:c0:00:00:51:39:21 and receives, for example, this in response:\n0000   55 60 01 18 40 21 00 51 08 02 01 02 08 03 01 02\n0010   09 02 01 03 08 03 01 03 08 02 01 07 16 03 01 07\n0020   16 02 01 09 01 03 01 09 01 e0 30\n\nIf we change one shortcut (set left double-pinch to skip forward), we get:\n0000   55 60 01 18 40 21 00 1d 08 02 01 02 09 03 01 02\n0010   09 02 01 03 08 03 01 03 08 02 01 07 16 03 01 07\n0020   16 02 01 09 01 03 01 09 01 39 6d\n\nWe see changes on bytes 8 and 13 (08 → 09), and in the last two bytes. If we change left double-pinch to voice assistant, we get:\n0000   55 60 01 18 40 21 00 1d 08 02 01 02 0b 03 01 02\n0010   09 02 01 03 08 03 01 03 08 02 01 07 16 03 01 07\n0020   16 02 01 09 01 03 01 09 01 b9 6e\n\nCompared to last time, only byte 13 is changed (to 0b). I guess byte 13 represents the actual action.\nLet’s try setting triple pinch to skip forward:\n0000   55 60 01 18 40 21 00 1d 08 02 01 02 0b 03 01 02\n0010   09 02 01 03 09 03 01 03 08 02 01 07 16 03 01 07\n0020   16 02 01 09 01 03 01 09 01 29 bc\n\nThis time the 21st byte is changed. If I set triple pinch to voice assistant, that 21st byte changes to 0b.\nThis is the table of shortcuts and byte positions:\nShortcutByte index (from 0)\nLeft double-pinch12\nLeft triple-pinch20\nLeft pinch-hold28\nLeft double-pinch-hold36\nRight double-pinch16\nRight triple-pinch24\nRight pinch-hold32\nRight double-pinch-hold40\n\nAnd of shortcut actions and their encodings:\nActionEncoding\nSkip Back0x08\nSkip Forward0x09\nVoice Assistant0x0b\nVolume Up0x12\nVolume Down0x13\nNoise Control (Active/Off)0x14\nNoise Control (Transparency/Active)0x16\nNoise Control (Transparency/Active/Off)0xa\nNoise Control (Transparency/Off)0x15\nNo Action0x01\n\nLooking at the commands to change shortcuts now (this is to set left triple-pinch to skip forward):\n0000   55 60 01 03 f0 05 00 59 01 02 01 03 09 de 71\n\nI noticed that the 13th byte encodes the shortcut action, and the previous two bytes match the previous two bytes before the index of that shortcut in the shortcut-info response as we figured out earlier. Now we can set the shortcut for any action.\nAnd what’s really cool is that like this we can use configurations that the official Nothing X app doesn’t allow, yet are possible on the device. For example, the app restricts double-pinch to skip forward/back and voice assistant. But now I can make double-pinch do noise control or volume up/down as well.\nThe Finished Product\nYou can get the CLI tool here: bharadwaj-raju / ear2ctl.\n$ ear2ctl info\nAddress: 2C:BE:EB:69:20:5A\nFirmware version: 1.0.1.101\nSerial number: SH10182307002807\n\n$ ear2ctl anc\nANC: off\n\n$ ear2ctl anc transparency\n\n$ ear2ctl anc\nANC: transparency\n\n$ ear2ctl shortcuts\nleft:\n        double-pinch: skip-forward\n        triple-pinch: skip-back\n        pinch-hold: noise-control-transparency-active-off\n        double-pinch-hold: voice-assistant\nright:\n        double-pinch: skip-forward\n        triple-pinch: skip-back\n        pinch-hold: voice-assistant\n        double-pinch-hold: noise-control-transparency-off\n\n$ ear2ctl shortcuts right double-pinch-hold no-action\n\n$ ear2ctl --help\nControls for the Nothing Ear (2)\n\nUsage: ear2ctl &lt;COMMAND&gt;\n\nCommands:\n  info              Device information\n  shortcuts         View and set pinch gestures\n  anc               Control active noise cancellation\n  ear-tip-fit-test  Start or stop the ear tip fit test\n  in-ear-detection  Turn in-ear detection on or off\n  low-latency-mode  Turn low latency mode on or off\n  help              Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)\n\nOptions:\n  -h, --help     Print help\n  -V, --version  Print version\n\n\n","id":"https://bharadwaj-raju.github.io/posts/nothing-ear-2-on-linux/","title":"Creating a Linux controller for the Nothing Ear (2)"},"https://bharadwaj-raju.github.io/posts/stacked-sines/":{"body":"\n\n\n\n\n    \n    “You are not a robot”\n\nSterk Hvalros creates a lot of art around the ideas of ripples and waves, and documents his process of making these pieces.\nWatching them, I wanted to experiment with some procedural generation along those lines.\nI thought about and tried some ways of representing and propagating perturbations like in the video, and my eventual idea was to generate pieces of sine waves for each horizontal line, and to “dampen” them to generate their ripple effects on all other lines.\n\nSine waves make this pretty nice, mathematically.

But I wanted to see if I could design my own, entirely fictional, “chip” with its own instructions and quirks and stuff. There is of course inspiration drawn from CHIP-8, both in terms of what I took and what I avoided.\nHere is the code: March&nbsp;&nbsp;(It’s named “March” as in “my architecture”, and also after the GCC flag.)&nbsp;\n.\nDesign\nThis thing has:\n\n32 2-byte registers\n32 level stack (only used to nest function calls)\n240x160 pixels full 24-bit RGB display, but with a palette of only 16 colors\n32 sprites\na timer\nA, B, X, Y and directional key input\n64 whole KiB of memory (addressable 2 bytes at a time)\na built-in 8x8 bitmap font for ASCII characters, public domain courtesy of Daniel Hepper\n\nYou can see that this was built to have more room than the CHIP-8, but not too much so.\nThere is only one single immediate mode instruction in this thing, and that is to set the value of a register. Everything else operates on registers. Nothing just takes a straightforward value. This makes you use and reuse a ton of registers for every little thing, but that’s the price we pay for flexibility. And this thing sure has flexibility; you can basically rewrite your own ROM on the fly.\nEach instruction is 3 words, or 6 bytes. The first word is the opcode, and the others are arguments. For example, the \ninstruction to draw a sprite looks like this:\n0x1007 0xXXYY 0x00NN  # draw sprite number stored in register N at the coordinates (registerX, registerY)\n\nThe Emulator Itself\nThe CPU, interpreter of instructions, sits in march.h. The march_cpu struct holds all the memory, stack, and \nprogram counter stuff. The function march_step executes the next instruction (by means of a massive switch-case) and \nmoves the program counter forward appropriately. Arguments are extracted by usual bit manipulation. For example, the \n“draw sprite” instruction I mentioned earlier is decoded like this:\n// reg is the register array\nuint8_t x = march-&gt;reg[arg1 &gt;&gt; 8];\nuint8_t y = march-&gt;reg[arg1 &amp; 0x00ff];\nuint8_t n = march-&gt;reg[arg2 &amp; 0x00ff];\n\nBy itself the march.h doesn’t do much; you have to write a frontend for it. There’s a no-graphics frontend in marchemu.c, mostly just useful for testing, and a graphical frontend using SFML in marchemu-gui.cpp.\nAssembler\nHonestly my favorite part of making this.\nThis is a sample for how code in this assembly looked:\nsetreg(R0, 0)\nsetreg(R1, 1)\nsetreg(R2, 10)\nsetreg(R3, 4*6)\nskipifeq(R0, R2, 3)\nadd(R0, R1, R0)\nprintreg(R0)\njump(R3)\nstopexec()\n\nThis prints numbers 1 to 10. Note the 4*6 there: it means the fourth instruction, because each instruction is 6 bytes long. You can see how that would get cumbersome — we’ll address it.\nOriginally my assembler worked in a bit too straightforward manner.\nThe “assembly” source files were just Python scripts, the “instructions” were function calls defined in asm.py, \nand asm.py would define those functions then read your “assembly” and just exec() it.\nThis was fun and made some cool things possible, like having your assembly generate random sprites at compile-time, or do math expressions and whatnot. That is how the project sat for some years. When I picked it back up recently, I had learned some basic parsing, and so I wanted to make a more proper assembler, with better features this time.\nAssembler v2: Labels\nCode written in the first generation of this assembler was difficult to follow, and you might as well forget about modifying it. That’s because there were no labels to jump to, you had to give it the exact instruction number. So if you added or removed any instructions, be sure to remember to alter all the jump positions!\nSo version 2 of my assembler added named labels. Now you could put labels anywhere, and the assembler would automatically replace them with the actual calculated instruction position.\nLet’s see how that same sample code looks now:\nsetreg(R0, 0)\nsetreg(R1, 1)\nsetreg(R2, 10)\nsetreg(R3, %loop)\n\n%loop:\nskipifeq(R0, R2, 3)\nadd(R0, R1, R0)\nprintreg(R0)\njump(R3)\nstopexec()\n\nMuch better.\nAssembler v2: Data-driven assembly\nI also didn’t like how my instructions and their arguments were specified in my spec.txt and my asm.py and my march.h. I could reduce at least two of those. So I made an instructions.json, which asm.py reads from to know what instructions there are and what arguments they take and how to pack them.\nHere is the entry in instructions.json for the sprite drawing one:\n\"0x1007\": {\n    \"arg-format\": [\n        \"0xXXYY\",\n        \"0x00NN\"\n    ],\n    \"description\": \"draw sprite regN at (regX, regY)\",\n    \"asm\": \"drawsprite\"\n}\n\nThe assembler has a pack_arguments function which uses the entries in arg-format to get the width and position of each argument. Then it just assembles the correct hex string based on this, and done.\nAnd this also now serves as the new “documentation” for the human programmer. Sure, it’s a bit more verbose than the txt, but with Ctrl+F one can manage.\nVersion 2 also actually parses the assembly, and doesn’t just straight-up exec() it. It’s not perfect still: you can’t split instructions over multiple lines, for instance.\nSomeday I might make this a better parser, but that’s fairly low priority for now.\nAssembler v2: Error reporting\nHaving the assembler fail with an IndexError because you didn’t provide enough arguments with no indication of what part of your code is causing it is less than ideal. Even worse is having the assembler silently generate wrong code because you passed in an argument which wouldn’t fit in the field, and it tried to pack it in there anyway.\nSo with some more effort, we can add some nice error reporting to our assembler. Now it tells you what went wrong and where, and uses the power of JSON-as-docs to even pull out the documentation for you:\nLine 55: Not enough arguments for setreg.\nArguments for setreg:\n    X, N (0x00XX 0xNNNN)\n    set register X to 0xNNNN\n\nand\nLine 50: Argument 32 cannot be packed into field of width 1.\nArguments for drawchar:\n    X, Y, F, B, C (0xXYFB 0x00CC)\n    draw ASCII character code regC at (regX, regY), fg palette = regF, bg palette = regB\nConsider using a register &lt;= 15.\n\nNow our assembler is a lot more usable.\nPrograms\nInvaders\nThe longest program I’ve written in this thing is a very basic Invaders clone.\n\nHere’s the source code: invaders.\nQuine\nHere’s a more interesting program: it displays its own ROM on the screen.\n\nHere’s the source code: guiquine and also below.\nsetreg(R_MEM_PTR, 0)\nsetreg(R_SHIFT_FOUR, 16)  # (x &gt;&gt; 4) == (x / 2^4)\nsetreg(R_INC, 1)\nsetreg(R_CHARMAP_ADDR, %charmap)\nsetreg(R_LOOP_ADDR, %loop)\nsetreg(R_X_POS, 4)\nsetreg(R_ONE, 1)\nsetreg(R_ZERO, 0)\nsetreg(R_255, 255)\nsetpalette(R_ONE, R_255, R_255, R_255)\nsetreg(R_Y_POS, 4)\nsetreg(R_PIXEL_SHIFT, 8)\nsetreg(R_MAX, 250)  # number of bytes in the ROM\nsetreg(R_X_MAX, 225)\n\nclearscreen(R_ZERO)\n\n%loop:\nreadmem(R_MEM, R_MEM_PTR)\nsetregXtoregY(R_UPPER, R_MEM)\nsetregXtoregY(R_LOWER, R_MEM)\ndiv(R_UPPER, R_SHIFT_FOUR, R_UPPER)\nsetregXtoregY(R_CHAR, R_CHARMAP_ADDR)\nadd(R_CHAR, R_UPPER, R_CHAR)\nreadmem(R_CHAR, R_CHAR)\ndrawchar(R_X_POS, R_Y_POS, R_ONE, R_ZERO, R_CHAR)\nadd(R_X_POS, R_PIXEL_SHIFT, R_X_POS)\nmul(R_UPPER, R_SHIFT_FOUR, R_UPPER)\nsubtract(R_LOWER, R_UPPER, R_LOWER)\nsetregXtoregY(R_CHAR, R_CHARMAP_ADDR)\nadd(R_CHAR, R_LOWER, R_CHAR)\nreadmem(R_CHAR, R_CHAR)\ndrawchar(R_X_POS, R_Y_POS, R_ONE, R_ZERO, R_CHAR)\nsetdrawflag()\nadd(R_MEM_PTR, R_INC, R_MEM_PTR)\nadd(R_X_POS, R_PIXEL_SHIFT, R_X_POS)\nskipifleq(R_X_POS, R_X_MAX, 2)\nsetreg(R_X_POS, 4)\nadd(R_Y_POS, R_PIXEL_SHIFT, R_Y_POS)\nskipifgeq(R_MEM_PTR, R_MAX, 1)\njump(R_LOOP_ADDR)\n\npauseexec()\n\n%charmap:\nliteralstr(\"0123456789ABCDEF\")\n\nThoughts\nOne of my favorite projects. It taught me parsing, bit manipulation, some idea of a low-level instruction set, and gave me a taste of programming in an assembly-level language.\nIf you’re bored or finished with the standard recommendation of CHIP-8, you might enjoy doing something like this.
